This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of regression techniques using an insurance dataset, inspired by a Kaggle competition. The project focuses on predicting insurance charges based on demographic and medical factors.

## 🚀 Project Overview
In this project, we aim to build regression models to understand and predict insurance charges. By analyzing the dataset, we extract meaningful insights and demonstrate the predictive power of machine learning models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and performance evaluation.

## 🛠️ Key Steps

 - Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values (if any)
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Scale numerical features
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualize correlations between features and the target variable
   - Detect outliers and understand distributions
 - Model Development:
   - **Baseline model:** Linear Regression
   - **Advanced models:** Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
 - Evaluation:
   - Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared
   - Compare performance across models
